-👋 Hi, I’m @Bruyten I'm a over-the-road truck driver by day. I am currently an I.T. student at Purdue Global. I'm only in my second semester there, but I love it!!
- 👀 I’m interested in web design although I'm very new at it. I'm looking to learn JavaScript and Python. I'm not to sure where all of it will take me as of yet.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. I am currently building a site for my web design class, which I will display on here soon. It's coming out really nice for being my very first site.
- 💞️ I am really interested in AI and robotics. One of my dreams is to 3D print a robot and build it from the ground up. I think it would be a really fun project.
- 📫 How to reach me ruyt.inc@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm 53 years old and a grandfather of 4 soon to be 5 grandchildren.
